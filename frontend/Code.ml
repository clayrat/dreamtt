(** The central idea to the elaboration algorithm is to distinguish
    introduction forms from elimination forms; unlike some classic
    bidirectional algorithms, this distinction does not line up exactly with {i
    checking} vs. {i synthesis}, but it interacts with it in a non-trivial way:
    we only synthesize elimination forms at positive types. *)
